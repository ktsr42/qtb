Specification: An Consolidator for Q Scripts

Objective

The q source consolidator reads a q script and resolves references to
other scripts.  This means that it outputs a consolidated script where
all other scripts loaded via \l are replaced with the actual contents
of the script that is given as an argument to \l.

While expanding \l statements, the assembler keeps track of the
scripts loaded and simply skips any additional reference to a script
that has already been loaded.


Necessary Variable Context Manipulations

When one q script loads a second one via \l, the q interpreter
preserves the context currently in effect.  It remains in effect while
the subscript is parsed, i.e. all unqualified variable references in
the secondary script are resolved relative it until the secondary
script changes the context via a \d statement.  In this sense the
context of the top-level script "leaks" into the secondary script.

However, after the second script has been loaded the current context
is restored from the preserved value.  This means that even if the
second script changes the context via \d, the context of the top-level
script is not affected; it does not "leak" out of the secondary one
when it is loaded.

For the q assembler script this means that it needs to keep track of
the effective context when expanding \l to the respective file
contents.
